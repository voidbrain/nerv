| **Issue** | Owner report 2026-11-04: a dashboard opened with `nerv open dashboard` signs out on every reload, because the token lived only in the tab's memory (the F-034 rule, archived in docs/archive/backlog-2026.md). Owner decision 2026-11-04: a tab session that survives a reload, instead of storing the admin token. |
| **Reproduce** | `nerv open dashboard`, then reload the page. |
| **Check** | The login code is swapped for a random dashboard session, never the admin token; it signs a reload in the same tab back in; it ends after 12 h, on a service restart, with `sessions revoke`, or when the tab closes; it cannot mint login codes or revoke, so it never renews itself; an admin token pasted by hand is never stored; the Angular workspace still signs in with `open`. |

<summary>Next action, estimates and evidence</summary>

**Next action / closure evidence:** Implemented in [PR #76](https://github.com/voidbrain/nerv/pull/76): `/api/session/exchange` returns `{token: session, expiresInMs}` (32 random bytes, at most 20 live, in the service's memory); requests with a live session count as the admin, except `/api/session/codes` and `/api/session/revoke` (403), which need the admin token; `nerv sessions revoke` ends them all; the dashboard keeps the session in its tab's sessionStorage (`nerv.dashboard.session`), resumes it on reload and drops it with a clear message on a 401. Checked: test/session.test.ts (exchange returns a session, not the token; it acts as the owner, cannot mint or revoke, expires, is revoked), test/headless.integration.ts (open → session signs doctor in → `sessions revoke` → 401), headless Chrome against a throwaway service (signed in after a reload; after `sessions revoke` the page says the session ended and nothing is kept).

**Resolution:** Closed 2026-11-04 as Verified. The owner checked it on Neo Tokyo-3 (signed in after a reload; `sessions revoke` ended the session); merged in [PR #76](https://github.com/voidbrain/nerv/pull/76), CI green on the PR and on main (run 41925260230).

### F-033

**Resume Misato after the owner approves**

| Signal | Priority | Status | Effort | Complete |
|:---:|---|---|---|---|
| 🔵 | ◻️ P2 | Closed | 🟢 Small | ~100% |

💻 **→ Human action required: No**<br />None: verified by the owner on Telegram and closed.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Issue** | A Misato action that waits for the owner runs once after approval, but the conversation stops there: Misato never sees the result, and further steps of the request are dropped. |
| **Reproduce** | `chat` a request whose action is Blue; approve it; Misato sends no follow-up and the sortie stays open. |
| **Check** | After an approval, the loop resumes with the recorded steps plus the outcome, within the same sortie and step limit; a rejected or expired approval is shown to Misato too; the sortie closes when Misato replies; the reply reaches the owner (inbox, later Telegram). |

<details>
<summary>Next action, estimates and evidence</summary>

**Next action / closure evidence:** Owner test 2026-11-04 on Neo Tokyo-3 (Telegram, `Remember that I drink coffee at 8`): the Blue card arrived, **Approve once** stored the fact and Misato's follow-up ("I've added that you drink coffee at 8 to your memory.") closed the sortie. Finding: before the follow-up the owner got "Hai già confermato di bere caffè alle 8…": the ledger shows that, after the card, the loop asked the model again, it re-proposed the same action (refused as already waiting) and then wrote a waiting reply that claimed the action was already confirmed, in Italian for an English request, 20 s after the card. Fixed in [PR #74](https://github.com/voidbrain/nerv/pull/74): a card now ends Misato's turn, with a reply written by the service (`waitingReply`, in the request's language by `requestLanguage`, falling back to the conversation): it names what waits and never says it happened; Misato carries on after the decision as before. The duplicate-proposal guard it made unreachable is removed. Checked: test/misato.test.ts, test/resume.test.ts, test/telegram.test.ts (Misato asked twice, not three times), full suite 100 pass. Earlier: implemented in [PR #35](https://github.com/voidbrain/nerv/pull/35): `misato.request`, `misato.step`, `misato.waiting` and `misato.resumed` events hold the loop's state; `Ledger.resumable` finds open Misato sorties whose awaited approvals are all decided, `Ledger.claimResume` claims each resume once; `Runtime.sweep` (every 2 s in `serve`, and right after a decision through the coordinator) adds the decisions as steps and continues the loop; Aoba sends the follow-up after the decision message. Checked: test/resume.test.ts (approve → follow-up and close; reject → nothing runs; a CLI decision outside the service is found; decided while the service was down → resumes after restart; a claimed resume is never handed out again), test/telegram.test.ts (tap → follow-up in the chat, after the decision message), and a live run on the owner's Ollama (temporary data home): Blue reminder waited, approval ran it, Misato replied in Italian and the sortie closed. The same run showed Misato copying an internal step note into its reply; the prompt now forbids copying step text. qwen2.5-coder's Italian is clumsy; gemma4:12b may write better replies (switch with `roles.misato.model` and `reload`). Found while building the loop ([PR #28](https://github.com/voidbrain/nerv/pull/28), 2026-11-04). Keep the loop's steps in the ledger so a resume does not depend on coordinator memory; deliver the follow-up reply to the local inbox.

**Resolution:** Closed 2026-11-04 as Verified. The owner approved a Blue card on Telegram and Misato resumed, replied and closed the sortie; the misleading waiting message found in that test is fixed in [PR #74](https://github.com/voidbrain/nerv/pull/74) (CI green on the PR and on main, run 41921444824).

### F-030

**Dummy Plug degraded mode**

| Signal | Priority | Status | Effort | Complete |
|:---:|---|---|---|---|
| 🔵 | ◻️ P1 | Closed | 🟢 Small | ~100% |

💻 **→ Human action required: No**<br />None: merged with green checks and closed. Optional owner check on Neo Tokyo-3: `osascript -e 'quit app "Ollama"'`, wait a minute: the dashboard tile says *degraded* and Health shows *S² local route ✗ down since …*; ask Aoba `what is on today?` → *I could not finish: Local route (S²) unreachable.*; then `open -a Ollama` and within a minute Health shows *reachable* and the service log prints *back after N min*.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Issue** | A model outage must not stop reminders or deterministic work, and the owner must see that the agent is degraded. |
| **Reproduce** | Make every model route unreachable; submit a reminder, a deterministic action and a model-needing request; restore the route. |
| **Check** | Status reports degraded with reason; reminders and deterministic pilots continue; model-needing sorties wait or expire with a visible reason; no local-only request is moved to the cloud; recovery is automatic and recorded. |

<details>
<summary>Next action, estimates and evidence</summary>

**Next action / closure evidence:** Implemented in [PR #72](https://github.com/voidbrain/nerv/pull/72): `src/route-health.ts` keeps each route's state (`ok`, `down`, `off`, `unknown`, since when, the last reason) from every real call in the brain process, and a TCP check of the local route every minute (no request, no model call); only outages count (unreachable, timed out, HTTP 5xx, key refused, rate limited), a bad reply does not. `runtime.ping` carries `routes`; `doctor` and `/api/status` add `routes` and `degraded` reasons; the brief lists them under Health; the service log prints one line when a route goes down and when it comes back (with how long it was down). The dashboard shows *degraded* in the Health tile and the base badge, a Dummy Plug line and one row per route. Reminders and the gate run in the scheduler process and never wait on a model; a model-needing request fails with the route's reason (Aoba: *I could not finish: …*) rather than waiting, so nothing is queued behind an outage; local-only asks never move to the cloud (selectRoute, test/model.test.ts). The cloud route has no active probe (it would spend quota): its state comes from real calls. Checked: test/dummy-plug.test.ts (state changes and reasons; through the brain process: down with reason, reminders still work, Misato fails with the reason, the route recovers on its own after the server returns), full suite 96 pass, headless process test; dashboard screenshot of a service whose local route is a dead port (tile *degraded*, Health *S² local route ✗ down since 22:03*, EVA-02 standby, base badge DEGRADED). Original plan: route health in the F-003 model adapter plus a status field; the A/B/C split already keeps reminders alive.

**Resolution:** Closed 2026-11-04 as Verified. Route health, degraded status in doctor, status, brief and dashboard, and automatic recovery merged in [PR #72](https://github.com/voidbrain/nerv/pull/72); every Check is covered by its automated tests (test/dummy-plug.test.ts through the brain process) and a dashboard check; CI green on the PR and on main (run 41913226560).

<summary>Next action, estimates and evidence</summary>

**Next action / closure evidence:** Implemented in [PR #71](https://github.com/voidbrain/nerv/pull/71): `@angular/build` and `@angular/cli` 22.2.3 → 22.2.5 (exact pins), which pull vite 8.3.5; the framework packages are already on their latest patch, 22.2.4.

Earlier: found 2026-11-04 while adding the model-route dependency ([PR #11](https://github.com/voidbrain/nerv/pull/11), model routes); kept out of that PR. `npm audit fix --force` proposes `@angular/build` 22.2.5, outside the pinned set: upgrade the Angular packages together in their own PR.

💻 **→ Human action required: No**<br />None: verified in daily use and closed.

| **Issue** | The web page keeps the admin token in tab memory only, so the owner had to paste it after every reload (owner, 2026-11-04). |
| **Reproduce** | Reload http://127.0.0.1:4317: the token form appears. |
| **Check** | `npm start -- open` opens the page signed in; the token never appears in a command line, URL or browser storage; the code is single-use, expires after 60 s and is removed from the address and history; a reused link shows a clear error; read-only and native clients cannot mint codes. |

<details>
<summary>Next action, estimates and evidence</summary>

**Next action / closure evidence:** Owner chose the `open` command over storing the token in the browser (2026-11-04), keeping the memory-only rule. Implemented in [PR #31](https://github.com/voidbrain/nerv/pull/31): `POST /api/session/codes` (admin, web server only, 128-bit codes, 60 s, at most 5 unused), `POST /api/session/exchange` (unauthenticated, one use), CLI `open` (`--print` shows the URL instead of opening it), the page reads `#code=`, clears it with `history.replaceState`, exchanges it and keeps the token in memory. Checked: test/session.test.ts (admin-only minting, single use, wrong, expired, limit), the headless process test (CLI `open` against a running `serve`, the URL carries no token, the exchange returns it), and headless Chrome against a temporary service (signed in; the same link again shows the error).

**Resolution:** Closed 2026-11-04 as Verified. The owner signed in with `nerv open dashboard` throughout 4 November (Neo Tokyo-3, after every restart and dashboard PR); the single-use code, its removal from the address and the memory-only token are covered by test/session.test.ts and headless Chrome (CI green: PR #31).

| **Issue** | The owner installs NERV on a mini PC and names the bases (NERV-01 Neo Tokyo-3, NERV-02 Tabgha, NERV-03 Bethany); there was no setting for it, the dashboard said TOKYO-3, and starting needed serve then open dashboard. |
| **Reproduce** | Install on a second machine; look for its name in the dashboard, doctor and brief. |

💻 **→ Human action required: No**<br />None: the per-action gate is verified and closed.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Issue** | Risk was classified once per request (Gendo) before any action existed, and a 3-model vote ran on non-trivial work. Risk belongs to each action; policy and reversibility checks are deterministic. |
| **Reproduce** | Run actions of each effect class (read, local reversible write, external write, irreversible, physical) with trusted and Ireul-tainted context; inspect Pattern, seat verdicts, Sync Ratio and whether the A.T. Field was issued. |
| **Check** | Every tool declares an effect class; Melchior (rules) and Balthasar (reversibility, budget, taint) are deterministic; Casper (intent) is a reasoning-blind model seat only for Orange/Blue; Green read/local work never calls a model reviewer; Blue always reaches Misato's apartment; any reject returns to the planner at most 3 times; the grant is checked on every executor call; ballots are recorded in Central Dogma. |

<details>
<summary>Next action, estimates and evidence</summary>

**Next action / closure evidence:** Implemented in [PR #8](https://github.com/voidbrain/nerv/pull/8) (gate, ledger, approvals): `src/policy.ts` (effect classes, Pattern, EVA class, Melchior/Balthasar, veto-only extra seats, Sync Ratio with inputs) and `Ledger.propose`/`authorize` (single-use grants bound to the argument hash, reject limit escalation). Scrolls in [PR #20](https://github.com/voidbrain/nerv/pull/20): `scrolls.json` in the data home, validated by `validatePolicy`, loaded by the CLI and the scheduler process; missing means the defaults, an invalid or others-writable file stops startup; `doctor` reports the rules and their source. Casper and executors in [PR #21](https://github.com/voidbrain/nerv/pull/21): `src/casper.ts` (reasoning-blind prompt with the request and the exact action, local route only, strict JSON verdict; a failure is no verdict), brain method `casper.verdict`, `Runtime.act` asks it only when `Ledger.preview` is not Green; `src/executors.ts` registers `reminders.list` (read), `reminders.add` and `reminders.cancel` (local writes) with executors in the scheduler process, run by `Store.runAction` right after `authorize` on a grant, or by `Store.decide` after the owner approves (once; a repeat never re-runs); `action.done`/`action.failed` events; owner sorties close when settled; `POST /api/actions` (admin) and CLI `act`; CLI `approve` no longer prints the grant ID. Planner as caller: Misato's loop (F-003, [PR #28](https://github.com/voidbrain/nerv/pull/28)) proposes every action through `Runtime.gate`; a reject returns to it with the reason. Live 2026-11-04: Casper on gemma4:12b via Ollama returned a parseable approve verdict for a Blue reminder, which still went to the owner. Remaining: cite the merged loop PR's green CI to verify. Original plan: effect classes, Scrolls policy pack, Pattern derivation, deterministic seats, Sync Ratio (0–100 % with its inputs), grant issuance with TTL and the executor check. Casper uses the F-003 model route once it exists; until then a Casper verdict is required input and the gate fails closed. Extra veto-only seats and consultants are F-025. Supersedes the request-level Gendo classification of 2026-11-02 ([NERV architecture](NERV/NERV-ARCHITECTURE.md)).

**Resolution:** Closed 2026-11-04 as Verified. Every Check item has dated evidence: deterministic Melchior/Balthasar, Casper only for Orange/Blue (Green never calls a model), Blue always to the owner, rejects back to the planner with escalation, the grant checked on every executor call, ballots in Central Dogma — test/ledger.test.ts, test/gate.test.ts and test/misato.test.ts, green CI on [PR #28](https://github.com/voidbrain/nerv/pull/28) (main run 41815791087), with the planner loop as the caller; Casper ran live on the owner's gemma4:12b (2026-11-04).

**Central Dogma sortie ledger and Maya trace events**

|:---:|---|---|---|---|
| 🔵 | ◻️ P1 | Closed | 🟢 Small | ~100% |

💻 **→ Human action required: No**<br />None: the ledger and its versioned event schema are verified and closed.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Issue** | Ballots, approvals and agent steps need an append-only record to debug, audit and display; a separate telemetry schema would drift from the dashboard. |
| **Reproduce** | Run a sortie with several actions including a reject and an approval; read its events back in order; locate the failing step from events alone. |
| **Check** | Sortie and action records with append-only events; every event carries sortie id, step, time and a bounded payload without secrets; read API pages events; the same schema feeds F-019 and later OpenTelemetry export. |

<details>
<summary>Next action, estimates and evidence</summary>

**Next action / closure evidence:** Implemented in [PR #8](https://github.com/voidbrain/nerv/pull/8) (gate, ledger, approvals): schema 2 tables (sorties, actions, grants, approvals, events), append-only events enforced by SQLite triggers, paged `Ledger.events`, CLI `events`, one-way migration noted in INSTALL. Paged reads added in [PR #9](https://github.com/voidbrain/nerv/pull/9) (approvals API): `events.page` RPC and `GET /api/sorties/ID/events` (max 50 per page). Payload versioning in [PR #16](https://github.com/voidbrain/nerv/pull/16) (schema 3): `src/events.ts` is the one schema (kinds, typed payloads, `EVENT_SCHEMA_VERSION`=1) for ledger, CLI, REST, RPC and the dashboard; each event stores `v` (schema-2 events read as 1); payloads capped at 16 KB, model verdict reasons at 500 characters, the Spear list at 50 with an exact count; event pages stop at 32 KB of payload, which fixes a page of long-reason ballots overflowing the 64 KB IPC frame (reproduced by the new cross-process test before the fix). The `step` in Check is the action ID: plan steps arrive with the F-017 planner. Event schema 2 in [PR #22](https://github.com/voidbrain/nerv/pull/22): grant events no longer carry the grant ID (the owner's first `act` run on 2026-11-04 showed it in `events`, contradicting the rule that grant IDs never leave the scheduler process; low risk, since grants are single-use, argument-bound, 60 s and no API accepts them), and version 1 rows are redacted on read. Remaining: F-019 consumes this schema, the closing check. Original plan: implement with F-017 in `src/`; OpenTelemetry export later and never blocking M2a. Merged scope with the F-019 decision-event schema on 2026-11-04.

**Resolution:** Closed 2026-11-04 as Verified. Append-only events with sortie id, action id, time, schema version and bounded payloads without grant IDs (schema 2); paged read API; the F-019 live dashboard reads them ([PR #36](https://github.com/voidbrain/nerv/pull/36), main run 41828578832). OpenTelemetry export, which the Check calls later, is not built; it would be its own record.

**Estimates:** Closed; ~100% complete. Closed 2026-11-04.

### F-001

**Complete harness adoption and propose a reusable Node profile**

| Signal | Priority | Status | Effort | Complete |
|:---:|---|---|---|---|
| 🔵 | ◻️ P1 | Closed | 🟢 Small | ~100% |

💻 **→ Human action required: No**<br />None: harness adopted with local Node conventions; a reusable Node profile is template work, not this backlog's.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Issue** | The published template has core and Angular but no Node profile. Adoption exists; remote PR/CI evidence is not available. |
| **Reproduce** | Follow README commands and the owning milestone in ROADMAP. |
| **Check** | All local harness checks pass; a future upstream profile has its own owned PR and fixtures. |

<details>
<summary>Next action, estimates and evidence</summary>

**Next action / closure evidence:** Validate the adopted tools, retain local Node conventions and record the missing reusable profile without modifying the upstream template in this bootstrap. All local harness checks pass; a future upstream profile has its own owned PR and fixtures.

**Resolution:** Closed 2026-11-04. Harness v3.1.1 core + Angular adopted; Node conventions kept as project lines in AGENTS.md; `check:harness` reports copied files match the template, and CI runs every harness check green on PR #7–#9 and main. The template has no Node stack; proposing one is a project-harness change and belongs in that repository's backlog (not recorded there as of this date).

**Estimates:** Closed; ~100% complete. Estimated 2026-11-01; closed 2026-11-04.

### F-018

**Fixed and JIT counselors/experts (outside council, suggest-only by default)**

| Signal | Priority | Status | Effort | Complete |
|:---:|---|---|---|---|
| 🔵 | ◻️ P1 | Closed | 🔴 Large | ~0% |

💻 **→ Human action required: No**<br />Support fixed local/always-on specialists and just-in-time (cloud, other-machine) experts that live outside the voting council and only suggest unless explicitly given a temporary seat.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Issue** | Specialists are needed without making every task a large multi-model committee. Hiring and authority boundaries are undefined. |
| **Reproduce** | Register a fixed specialist and a JIT expert; run tasks that should and should not hire them; inspect suggestions vs binding votes. |
| **Check** | Expert roster with capability ads, cost, privacy and availability; hiring decision is cheap/rule-based; default mode is suggest-only; structured suggestion payload (proposal, confidence, evidence, cost/risk); temporary vote seat and progressive promotion are explicit and logged; MCP/API tools can appear as experts. |

<details>
<summary>Next action, estimates and evidence</summary>

**Next action / closure evidence:** Define counselor/expert registry and hiring policy in the router (Gendo). Core MAGI remains small and authoritative. Fixed and JIT experts default to suggest-only; promotion into stronger roles follows progressive-trust rules (link F-007 / F-025). Remote experts are enrolled workers (F-005/F-006), not permanent council members. Dashboard expert-pool panel reflects real roster state.

**Estimates:** Large remaining effort; ~0% complete. Estimated 2026-11-02.

### F-038

**Set up model routes from the CLI, the install and the dashboard, finding Ollama and its models**

| Signal | Priority | Status | Effort | Complete |
|:---:|---|---|---|---|
| 🔵 | ◻️ P2 | Closed | 🟡 Medium | ~100% |

💻 **→ Human action required: No**<br />None: verified by the owner on Tabgha and Neo Tokyo-3 and closed.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Issue** | Owner report 2026-11-04: Tabgha shows DEGRADED with "Misato not set · Casper local route not configured" because it has no model routes, and the only way to set them is editing config.json by hand. The owner asks for a way from the CLI and the dashboard, as a step of a base's installation, for local models and APIs, finding Ollama on its default port and listing the models it has. |
| **Reproduce** | Install a new base (Tabgha) with Ollama running; open its dashboard: degraded, no route; nothing offers the installed models. |
| **Check** | `nerv models` (and `init`) probe `http://127.0.0.1:11434` and list the installed models (Ollama `/api/tags`), let the owner pick Misato's and Casper's, write `models` in config.json and reload without a restart; the dashboard shows the routes and, for the admin, the same choice; the cloud route is enabled with its model while the key is only ever entered in a terminal prompt or file, never in the browser, a command line or config; a probe that finds nothing says how to install or start Ollama; validation is the same as config.json's. |

<details>
<summary>Next action, estimates and evidence</summary>

**Next action / closure evidence:** Owner test 2026-11-05: on Tabgha, `nerv models set misato MODEL` with an empty Ollama said *Installed: none*; after `ollama pull`, the dashboard's Models panel applied *Misato local (gemma4:12b) · Casper local (gemma4:12b)*, Tabgha came ONLINE, and a reminder went through card, approval, run and delivery. Follow-ups fixed in [PR PR_FX]: an empty Ollama now says which model to pull; *The NERV service is not running … Start it with: nerv launch*; Casper's options say *(local)* like Misato's. Implemented in [PR #78](https://github.com/voidbrain/nerv/pull/78), all three slices: `src/model-setup.ts` (`detectOllama` reads `/api/tags`; `planModels` changes roles and the cloud route through `validateModels` before anything is written and refuses a local model Ollama does not list, Misato on the cloud without the route on, or the route off under Misato; `setupAtInit`; `effectiveRoles`, `modelsReport`); CLI `models`, `models set misato|casper …`, `models cloud on|off`, `models key` (hidden prompt, `anthropic-key` 0600); `init` puts both roles on Ollama's largest model when nothing is set (`NERV_OLLAMA` overrides the address); `GET`/`PUT /api/models` (admin or a dashboard session; the key is never accepted or returned, only whether it is saved) reload the brain in place; the dashboard's Models panel picks each role from Ollama's list, keeps an unapplied choice across refreshes, and turns the cloud route on or off. Checked: test/model-setup.test.ts (detection, planning and refusals, init, the CLI with a fake Ollama, the API through the brain process: roles switch without a restart), suite 107 pass, headless 3 pass; headless Chrome against a throwaway service on the real Ollama: the panel listed its three models, a Casper change survived a refresh and Apply wrote config.json and switched the running brain. Owner decision 2026-11-04: a cloud API key is entered only at a hidden terminal prompt (`nerv models key`) and written straight to its private file; the dashboard can turn the cloud route on and pick its model but never takes the key. Planned 2026-11-04 (owner request). Slices: (1) `nerv models` with Ollama detection and model choice for Misato and Casper, reload in place; (2) a step in `init` and in INSTALL for a new base; (3) a dashboard Models panel (admin) with the detected models and the cloud route's state. Related: F-037 asks doctor to list a base's local models (Windows), and F-030 reports a route that is down.

**Resolution:** Closed 2026-11-05 as Verified. Model setup from the CLI, `init` and the dashboard ([PR #78](https://github.com/voidbrain/nerv/pull/78), CI green on the PR and on main, run 41927867065), checked by the owner on both bases; the wording follow-ups are in [PR PR_FX].

**Estimates:** Closed; ~100% complete. Closed 2026-11-05.
